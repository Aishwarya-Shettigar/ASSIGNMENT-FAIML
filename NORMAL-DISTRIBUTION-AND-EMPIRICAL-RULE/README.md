# Normal Distribution and Empirical Rule
## Domain choosen: Healthcare – Adult Resting Heart Rate

### 1.Introduction

In the Healthcare domain, many physiological measurements follow a Normal Distribution, also known as the Gaussian Distribution. 
Examples include:

- Blood pressure

- Cholesterol levels

- Body temperature

- Resting heart rate
We analyze Adult Resting Heart Rate and demonstrate how it follows the Normal Distribution and how the Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule) applies.

### 2.What is Resting Heart Rate:

Resting Heart Rate (RHR) is the number of times a person's heart beats per minute while they are at complete rest.

For healthy adults:

- Typical range: 60–100 bpm

- Athletes may have lower values (40–60 bpm)

When measured across a large population, resting heart rate forms a bell-shaped pattern.

### 3.Why Resting Heart Rate Follows Normal Distribution

When data is:

1.Collected from a large population

2.Influenced by many small biological factors

3.Naturally centered around an average

It tends to form a Normal Distribution.

Heart rate is affected by:

 - Age

 - Fitness level

 - Genetics

 - Stress levels

- Lifestyle

Because these factors vary randomly, the overall distribution becomes symmetric around the mean.

### 4.Mathematical Formula of Normal Distribution

The probability density function is:

Where:

 - μ = Mean

 - σ = Standard deviation

 - x = Observed value

This formula creates the bell-shaped curve.

### 5.Assumed Dataset for Analysis

For this example, we consider realistic population values:

 - Mean (μ) = 72 bpm

 - Standard Deviation (σ) = 8 bpm

This means:

 - The average resting heart rate is 72 bpm.

 - Most people's heart rates vary about 8 bpm from the mean.

### 6.Understanding the Normal Distribution Curve

The graph plotted represents:

 - X-axis → Heart Rate (bpm)

 - Y-axis → Probability Density

The highest point of the curve is at the mean (72 bpm).
The curve is symmetric on both sides.

Key points marked on the graph:

| Standard Deviation | Value  |
| :----------------: | :-----:|
| μ − 1σ             | 64 bpm |
| μ + 1σ             | 80 bpm |
| μ − 2σ             | 56 bpm |
| μ + 2σ             | 88 bpm |
| μ − 3σ             | 48 bpm |
| μ + 3σ             | 96 bpm |

### 7.Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)

The Empirical Rule applies only to Normal Distributions.

It states:

1) 68% Rule (Within 1 Standard Deviation)

Range: 72 ± 8
-  64 bpm to 80 bpm

Interpretation: About 68% of healthy adults have a resting heart rate between 64 and 80 bpm.

This is the most common range.

2) 95% Rule (Within 2 Standard Deviations)

Range: 72 ± 16
 - 56 bpm to 88 bpm

Interpretation: About 95% of healthy adults fall within this range.

Values outside this range are uncommon.
