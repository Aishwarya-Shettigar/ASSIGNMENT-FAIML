# Comparison of Datasets Using Standard Deviation

## 1. Abstract

This study compares three datasets that share the same mean (μ = 55) but differ in their standard deviations (σₐ = 4, σᵦ = 10, σ𝒸 = 15). The objective is to determine which dataset demonstrates greater consistency and reliability using statistical analysis and graphical interpretation through normal distribution curves.

## 2. Introduction

In statistics, standard deviation is a fundamental measure of dispersion that quantifies the extent to which data values deviate from the mean. When multiple datasets share the same mean, the dataset with the smallest standard deviation is considered more consistent, as its data points are more closely clustered around the mean.

This analysis evaluates three datasets with identical means but different standard deviations to determine which dataset is statistically preferable.

## 3. Given Data

 - Mean (μ) = 55

 - Standard Deviation of Dataset A (σₐ) = 4

 - Standard Deviation of Dataset B (σᵦ) = 10

 - Standard Deviation of Dataset C (σ𝒸) = 15

### 4.1 Standard Deviation Formula

Where:

x = individual observation

μ = mean

N = number of observations

### 4.2 Interpretation

 - A smaller standard deviation indicates that data values are concentrated near the mean.

 - A larger standard deviation indicates that data values are more widely dispersed.

Since all three datasets have the same mean, comparison depends solely on the magnitude of their standard deviations.

## 5. Numerical Comparison

| Dataset | Mean (μ) | Standard Deviation (σ) | Level of Variability |
| :-----: | :------: | :--------------------: | :------------------: |
| A       | 55       | 4                      | Low                  |
| B       | 55       | 10                     | Moderate             |
| C       | 55       | 15                     | High                 |

From the table, Dataset A exhibits the smallest dispersion, whereas Dataset C shows the greatest variability.

**Interpretation of Normal Distribution Curves**

* Dataset A (σ = 4)
The curve is narrow and peaked, indicating that values are tightly clustered around the mean. This reflects high consistency.

* Dataset B (σ = 10)
The curve is moderately spread, indicating moderate variability.

* Dataset C (σ = 15)
The curve is wide and flatter, indicating substantial dispersion and lower consistency.

The width of the curve increases as the standard deviation increases.

## 7. Conclusion

Based on statistical analysis and graphical interpretation, Dataset A is the most consistent and reliable dataset among the three.

Since it has the smallest standard deviation (σ = 4), it exhibits the least variability around the mean (μ = 55).

**Result: Dataset A is statistically better than Dataset B and Dataset C.**
